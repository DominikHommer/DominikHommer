## My Projects
### Currently in Progress 🚧

I'm in the process of building up my GitHub repositories, moving projects from local storage to the cloud to share my journey as a developer more publicly. You'll soon find projects here ranging from the simple to the complex, all showcasing my passion for artificial intelligence and data science.

Whether it's building machine learning models, developing software in C++, or analyzing data, each project is a reflection of my commitment to learning and growth in this dynamic field. Please note that this section is currently under construction as I work to upload and document my work. Stay tuned for updates!
